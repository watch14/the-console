# AirBnB Clone Project - Command Interpreter

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project is the initial step in building a full web application that mimics the functionalities of AirBnB. The primary focus of this phase is to develop a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects.

## Command Interpreter üî≥
The command interpreter allows you to interact with the AirBnB objects by providing the following functionalities:

Create a new object (e.g., User, Place).
Retrieve an object from a file, database, etc.
Perform operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.).
Update attributes of an object.
Destroy an object.

### Getting Started üß™
To start the command interpreter, run the following command:

```bash
  ./console.py
```

This will launch the interactive mode, and you will see the prompt (hbnb).


### Usage üìë
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use the following commands:

help: Display a list of documented commands.
quit: Exit the command interpreter.
```bash
  $ ./console.py
  (hbnb) help
  Documented commands (type help <topic>):
  ========================================
  EOF   help   create   quit ...

  (hbnb) quit
  $
```
create: Creates a new instance of BaseModel.

```bash
  ./console.py
  (hbnb) create BaseModel
